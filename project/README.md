# Complex Systems Project

## swarm.py
Implementation of PSO, with some basic plotting.

## particle.py
holds the Particle class
Also holds Bayley's initial stuff, which I didn't want to get rid of

## fit.py
Functions to fit the PSO algorithm too

## params.py
Variables for PSO, bounds on fitness functions

## plot.py
Plots the fitness functions

## pyswarms-test.py
tests with the pyswarms library for comparison

# Plots
* plot the average value at each iteration (the best case for the chosen functions is all 0)
* how does convergence scale with the number of particles
* time to converge affected by number of particles
