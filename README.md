# Complex Systems final project

## archive
* previous working copy of the schelling code. Saved for safe keeping.

# deap-examples
* examples of working PSO with the DEAP and pyswarms libraries. 

# project
* our working project exploring different policies of Particle Swarm Optimization with the goal of quicker convergence, more accurate convergence, faster (user time) convergence. 

# schelling
* code for the second homework exploring schelling's policies and discrimination

<!-- 
scratch.py is my current working script for the pso. I haven't worked on the neighborhood pso yet, but I think for the most part I have the basic global pso functioning.
swarms.py is a working global and local pso using pyswarms, its similar to deap but much easier imo

with that being said, the particles aren't converging properly in my scratch network, I'm using the rastrigin function and
the particles are ending close to 0,0 but I am getting much better results with DEAP and pyswarms PSOs

I think it could have something to do with my parameters, but it also could be in my init of each particle. feel free to try something out in the meantime. 

also please disregard my spaghetti code, I am an awful coder, but I promise I am getting better
